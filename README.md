<h2>Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System</h2>
<h4>Project Description</h4>
This project leverages machine learning to recommend the most suitable crops and fertilizers based on soil conditions, weather parameters, and other environmental factors. It aims to assist farmers in improving crop yield and optimizing resource usage by providing data-driven insights.

<h3>Features</h3>
-Predicts the best crop for a given soil and climate condition.
-Recommends fertilizers tailored to soil nutrient requirements.
-Visualizes soil properties and crop suggestions using graphs and charts.
-Simple and intuitive interface for users.
<h3>Dataset</h3>
The project uses the Crop Recommendation Dataset, which includes soil properties like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH, and climate variables such as temperature and humidity.
.The source is from kaggle dataset

<h4>Technologies Used</h4>
-Programming Language: Python
-Libraries:
           -pandas, numpy for data manipulation
           -scikit-learn for machine learning
           -matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization
<h4>Usage</h4>
-Input soil parameters (N, P, K, pH) and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).
-The system will recommend:
-The most suitable crop for the input conditions.
-Fertilizers that improve soil nutrient balance.
-View the results and download reports if needed.
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<h5>Data Preprocessing:</h5>
-The dataset is cleaned and features are scaled for model training.
<h5>Model Training:</h5>
Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Trees) are trained to predict crops and recommend fertilizers.
<h5>Prediction:</h5>
User inputs are processed to generate crop and fertilizer recommendations.
<h5>Visualization:</h5>
Insights are displayed using graphs for better understanding.
